----------
Securities valuation: Securities, including options and futures contracts,
traded on a recognized exchange are generally valued at the last sale price on
the exchange or market on which such securities are primarily traded. Securities
traded on Nasdaq are generally valued at the Nasdaq official closing price.
Securities traded only over-the-counter are generally valued at the mean of the
latest bid and asked prices. Debt securities will generally be valued using
prices provided by a pricing service which may employ various indications of
value including but not limited to broker-dealer quotations. Restricted
securities, securities for which market quotations are not readily available,
and certain other assets may be fair valued under procedures adopted by the
Board of Trustees. Short-term investments that mature in 60 days or less are
valued at amortized cost, which approximates current market value. Investments
in other Nations Funds are valued at their net asset value as determined by the
applicable Nations Funds' prospectus.

----------
Securities valuation: Securities, including options and futures contracts,
traded on a recognized exchange are generally valued at the last sale price on
the exchange or market on which such securities are primarily traded. Securities
traded on Nasdaq are generally valued at the Nasdaq official closing price.
Securities traded only over-the-counter are generally valued at the mean of the
latest bid and asked prices. Debt securities will generally be valued using
prices provided by a pricing service which may employ various indications of
value including but not limited to broker-dealer quotations. Restricted
securities, securities for which market quotations are not readily available,
and certain other assets may be fair valued under procedures adopted by the
Board of Trustees. Short-term investments that mature in 60 days or less are
valued at amortized cost, which approximates current market value. Investments
in other Nations Funds are valued at their net asset value as determined by the
applicable Nations Funds' prospectus.

----------
Securities valuation: Securities, including options and futures contracts,
traded on a recognized exchange are generally valued at the last sale price on
the exchange or market on which such securities are primarily traded. Securities
traded on Nasdaq are generally valued at the Nasdaq official closing price.
Securities traded only over-the-counter are generally valued at the mean of the
latest bid and asked prices. Debt securities will generally be valued using
prices provided by a pricing service which may employ various indications of
value including but not limited to broker-dealer quotations. Restricted
securities, securities for which market quotations are not readily available,
and certain other assets may be fair valued under procedures adopted by the
Board of Trustees. Short-term investments that mature in 60 days or less are
valued at amortized cost, which approximates current market value. Investments
in other Nations Funds are valued at their net asset value as determined by the
applicable Nations Funds' prospectus.

Options: The Fund may purchase put options on stock index futures contracts,
stock indices, swap contracts ("swaptions") or equity securities for the purpose
of hedging the relevant portion of its portfolio securities against an
anticipated market-wide decline or against declines in the values of portfolio
securities, and may purchase call options on such futures contracts as a hedge
against a market advance when they are not fully invested. The Fund may write
options on such futures contracts primarily for the purpose of terminating
existing positions. The Fund may also engage these techniques for non-hedging
purposes such as seeking yield enhancement.

The Fund may write covered call options and put options on securities in which
its is permitted to invest from time to time in seeking to attain the Fund's
objective. Call options written by the Fund give the holder the right to buy the
underlying securities from the Fund at a stated exercise price; put options give
the holder the right to sell the underlying to the Fund at a stated price. In
the case of put options, the Fund is required to maintain in a separate account
liquid assets with a value equal to or greater than the exercise price of the
underlying securities. The Fund may also write combinations of covered puts and
calls on the same underlying security. When the Fund purchases an option, it
pays a premium and an amount equal to that premium is recorded as an asset. When
the Fund writes an option, it receives a premium and an amount equal to that
premium is recorded as a liability. The asset or liability is adjusted daily to
reflect the current market value of the option.

The Fund typically receive a premium from writing a put or call option, which
would increase the Fund's return in the event the option expires unexercised or
is closed out at a profit. The amount of the premium would reflect, among other
things, the relationship of the market price of the underlying security to the
exercise price of the option, the term of the option and the volatility of the
market price of the underlying security. By writing a call option, the Fund
limits its opportunity to profit from any increase in the market value of the
underlying security above the exercise price of the option. By writing a put
option, the Fund assumes the risk that it may be required to purchase the
underlying security for an exercise price higher than its then current market
value, resulting in a potential capital loss if the purchase price exceeds the
market value plus the amount of the premium received.

The Fund may terminate an option that it has written prior to its expiration by
entering into a closing purchase transaction in which it purchases an option
having the same terms as the option written. The Fund will realize a profit or
loss from such transaction if the cost of such transaction is less or more than
the premium received from the writing of the option. In the case of a put
option, any loss so incurred may be partially or entirely offset by the premium
received. Because increases in the market price of a call option will generally
reflect increases in the market price of the underlying security, any loss
resulting from the repurchase of a call option is likely to be offset in whole
or in part by unrealized appreciation of the underlying security owned by the
Fund.

----------
Securities valuation: Securities, including options and futures contracts,
traded on a recognized exchange are generally valued at the last sale price on
the exchange or market on which such securities are primarily traded. Securities
traded on Nasdaq are generally valued at the Nasdaq official closing price.
Securities traded only over-the-counter are generally valued at the mean of the
latest bid and asked prices. Debt securities will generally be valued using
prices provided by a pricing service which may employ various indications of
value including but not limited to broker-dealer quotations. Restricted
securities, securities for which market quotations are not readily available,
and certain other assets may be fair valued under procedures adopted by the
Board of Trustees. Short-term investments that mature in 60 days or less are
valued at amortized cost, which approximates current market value. Investments
in other Nations Funds are valued at their net asset value as determined by the
applicable Nations Funds' prospectus.

Notes to Investment Portfolio:

Securities valuation: Securities are valued on the basis of amortized cost,
which approximates current market value. Amortized cost valuation involves
initially valuing an instrument at its cost and thereafter assuming a constant
accretion to maturity of any discount or amortization of any premium, as long as
the effect of fluctuating interest rates on the market value of the instrument
is not significant. Restricted securities and certain other assets may be valued
under procedures adopted by the Board of Trustees.

*    Cost for federal income tax purposes is $2,123,188.

**   Variable rate demand notes. The interest rate shown reflects the rate in
     effect at December 31, 2004. These securities are subject to demand
     features of either one, seven or thirty days.

#    Security not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. These
     securities may be resold in transactions exempt from registration to
     qualified institutional buyers.

@@   Restricted security.

Notes to Investment Portfolio:

Securities valuation: Securities are valued on the basis of amortized cost,
which approximates current market value. Amortized cost valuation involves
initially valuing an instrument at its cost and thereafter assuming a constant
accretion to maturity of any discount or amortization of any premium, as long as
the effect of fluctuating interest rates on the market value of the instrument
is not significant. Restricted securities and certain other assets may be valued
under procedures adopted by the Board of Trustees.

Repurchase agreements: Each Fund may engage in repurchase agreement
transactions. Under the terms of a typical repurchase agreement, a Fund takes
possession of an underlying debt obligation subject to an obligation of the
seller to repurchase, and the obligation of the Fund to resell, the underlying
debt obligation at an agreed-upon price and date, thereby determining the yield
during the Fund's holding period. This arrangement results in a fixed rate of
return that is not subject to market fluctuations during the Fund's holding
period. The value of the collateral must be at least equal at all times to the
total amount of the repurchase obligation, including interest. Generally, in the
event of counterparty default, the Fund has the right to use the collateral to
offset losses incurred. There would be a potential loss to the Fund in the event
the Fund is delayed or prevented from exercising its right to dispose of the
collateral securities, including the risk of a possible decline in the value of
the underlying securities during the

<PAGE>

period the Fund seeks to assert its right. The Funds' investment adviser, under
the oversight of the Board of Trustees, monitors the value of collateral
received as well as the creditworthiness of those banks and dealers with which
the Funds enter into repurchase agreements to evaluate potential risks.

Notes to Investment Portfolio:

Securities valuation: Securities are valued on the basis of amortized cost,
which approximates current market value. Amortized cost valuation involves
initially valuing an instrument at its cost and thereafter assuming a constant
accretion to maturity of any discount or amortization of any premium, as long as
the effect of fluctuating interest rates on the market value of the instrument
is not significant. Restricted securities and certain other assets may be valued
under procedures adopted by the Board of Trustees.

Repurchase agreements: Each Fund may engage in repurchase agreement
transactions. Under the terms of a typical repurchase agreement, a Fund takes
possession of an underlying debt obligation subject to an obligation of the
seller to repurchase, and the obligation of the Fund to resell, the underlying
debt obligation at an agreed-upon price and date, thereby determining the yield
during the Fund's holding period. This arrangement results in a fixed rate of
return that is not subject to market fluctuations during the Fund's holding
period. The value of the collateral must be at least equal at all times to the
total amount of the repurchase obligation, including interest. Generally, in the
event of counterparty default, the Fund has the right to use the collateral to
offset losses incurred. There would be a potential loss to the Fund in the event
the Fund is delayed or prevented from exercising its right to dispose of the
collateral securities, including the risk of a possible decline in the value of
the underlying securities during the period the Fund seeks to assert its right.
The Funds' investment adviser, under the oversight of the Board of Trustees,
monitors the value of collateral received as well as the creditworthiness of
those banks and dealers with which the Funds enter into repurchase agreements to
evaluate potential risks.

Notes to Investment Portfolio:

Securities valuation: Securities are valued on the basis of amortized cost,
which approximates current market value. Amortized cost valuation involves
initially valuing an instrument at its cost and thereafter assuming a constant
accretion to maturity of any discount or amortization of any premium, as long as
the effect of fluctuating interest rates on the market value of the instrument
is not significant. Restricted securities and certain other assets may be valued
under procedures adopted by the Board of Trustees.

*    Cost for federal income tax purposes is $5,775,180.

**   Variable rate demand notes. The interest rate shown reflects the rate in
     effect at December 31, 2004. These securities are subject to demand
     features of either one, seven or thirty days.

***  Zero coupon security. The rate shown reflects the yield to maturity at
     December 31, 2004.

#    Security not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. These
     securities may be resold in transactions exempt from registration to
     qualified institutional buyers.

+    Amount represents less than 0.1%.

@@   Restricted security.

Notes to Investment Portfolio:

Securities valuation: Securities are valued on the basis of amortized cost,
which approximates current market value. Amortized cost valuation involves
initially valuing an instrument at its cost and thereafter assuming a constant
accretion to maturity of any discount or amortization of any premium, as long as
the effect of fluctuating interest rates on the market value of the instrument
is not significant. Restricted securities and certain other assets may be valued
under procedures adopted by the Board of Trustees.

*    Cost for federal income tax purposes is $118,063.

**   Variable rate demand notes. The interest rate shown reflects the rate in
     effect at December 31, 2004. These securities are subject to demand
     features of either one, seven or thirty days.

#    Security not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. These
     securities may be resold in transactions exempt from registration to
     qualified institutional buyers.

Securities valuation: Securities are valued on the basis of amortized cost,
which approximates current market value. Amortized cost valuation involves
initially valuing an instrument at its cost and thereafter assuming a constant
accretion to maturity of any discount or amortization of any premium, as long as
the effect of fluctuating interest rates on the market value of the instrument
is not significant. Restricted securities and certain other assets may be valued
under procedures adopted by the Board of Trustees.

Notes to Investment Portfolio:

Securities valuation: Securities are valued on the basis of amortized cost,
which approximates current market value. Amortized cost valuation involves
initially valuing an instrument at its cost and thereafter assuming a constant
accretion to maturity of any discount or amortization of any premium, as long as
the effect of fluctuating interest rates on the market value of the instrument
is not significant. Restricted securities and certain other assets may be valued
under procedures adopted by the Board of Trustees.

Repurchase agreements: Each Fund may engage in repurchase agreement
transactions. Under the terms of a typical repurchase agreement, a Fund takes
possession of an underlying debt obligation subject to an obligation of the
seller to repurchase, and the obligation of the Fund to resell, the underlying
debt obligation at an agreed-upon price and date, thereby determining the yield
during the Fund's holding period. This arrangement results in a fixed rate of
return that is not subject to market fluctuations during the Fund's holding
period. The value of the collateral must be at least equal at all times to the
total amount of the repurchase obligation, including interest. Generally, in the
event of counterparty default, the Fund has the right to use the collateral to
offset losses incurred. There would be a potential loss to the Fund in the event
the Fund is delayed or prevented from exercising its right to dispose of the
collateral securities, including the risk of a possible decline in the value of
the underlying securities during the period the Fund seeks to assert its right.
The Funds' investment adviser, under the oversight of the Board of Trustees,
monitors the value of collateral received as well as the creditworthiness of
those banks and dealers with which the Funds enter into repurchase agreements to
evaluate potential risks.

*    Cost for federal income tax purposes is $8,711,617.

----------
Securities valuation: Securities are generally valued by an independent pricing
service. These valuations may be based upon a matrix pricing system and/or
appraisals which considers such factors as security prices, yields, maturities,
redemption features and credit ratings on comparable securities. Certain
securities may be valued based upon quotes provided by one or more principal
market makers. Restricted securities, securities for which market quotations are
not readily available, and certain other assets may be fair valued under
procedures adopted by the Board of Trustees. Short-term investments that mature
in 60 days or less are valued at amortized cost, which approximates current
market value. Investments in other Nations Funds are valued at their net asset
value as determined by the applicable Nations Funds' prospectus.

Securities valuation: Securities are generally valued by an independent pricing
service. These valuations may be based upon a matrix pricing system and/or
appraisals which considers such factors as security prices, yields, maturities,
redemption features and credit ratings on comparable securities. Certain
securities may be valued based upon quotes provided by one or more principal
market makers. Restricted securities, securities for which market quotations are
not readily available, and certain other assets may be fair valued under
procedures adopted by the Board of Trustees. Short-term investments that mature
in 60 days or less are valued at amortized cost, which approximates current
market value. Investments in other Nations Funds are valued at their net asset
value as determined by the applicable Nations Funds' prospectus.

Securities valuation: Securities are generally valued by an independent pricing
service. These valuations may be based upon a matrix pricing system and/or
appraisals which considers such factors as security prices, yields, maturities,
redemption features and credit ratings on comparable securities. Certain
securities may be valued based upon quotes provided by one or more principal
market makers. Restricted securities, securities for which market quotations are
not readily available and certain other assets may be fair valued under
procedures adopted by the Board of Trustees. Short-term investments that mature
in 60 days or less are valued at amortized cost, which approximates current
market value. Investments in other Nations Funds are valued at their net asset
value as determined by the applicable Nations Funds' prospectus.

----------
Securities valuation: Securities are generally valued by an independent pricing
service. These valuations may be based upon a matrix pricing system and/or
appraisals which considers such factors as security prices, yields, maturities,
redemption features and credit ratings on comparable securities. Certain
securities may be valued based upon quotes provided by one or more principal
market makers. Restricted securities, securities for which market quotations are
not readily available, and certain other assets may be fair valued under
procedures adopted by the Board of Trustees. Short-term investments that mature
in 60 days or less are valued at amortized cost, which approximates current
market value. Investments in other Nations Funds are valued at their net asset
value as determined by the applicable Nations Funds' prospectus.

----------
Securities valuation: Securities are generally valued by an independent pricing
service. These valuations may be based upon a matrix pricing system and/or
appraisals which considers such factors as security prices, yields, maturities,
redemption features and credit ratings on comparable securities. Certain
securities may be valued based upon quotes provided by one or more principal
market makers. Restricted securities, securities for which market quotations are
not readily available, and certain other assets may be fair valued under
procedures adopted by the Board of Trustees. Short-term investments that mature
in 60 days or less are valued at amortized cost, which approximates current
market value. Investments in other Nations Funds are valued at their net asset
value as determined by the applicable Nations Funds' prospectus.

Securities valuation: Securities are generally valued by an independent pricing
service. These valuations may be based upon a matrix pricing system and/or
appraisals which considers such factors as security prices, yields, maturities,
redemption features and credit ratings on comparable securities. Certain
securities may be valued based upon quotes provided by one or more principal
market makers. Restricted securities, securities for which market quotations are
not readily available, and certain other assets may be fair valued under
procedures adopted by the Board of Trustees. Short-term investments that mature
in 60 days or less are valued at amortized cost, which approximates current
market value. Investments in other Nations Funds are valued at their net asset
value as determined by the applicable Nations Funds' prospectus.

Securities valuation: Securities are generally valued by an independent pricing
service. These valuations may be based upon a matrix pricing system and/or
appraisals which consider such factors as security prices, yields, maturities,
redemption features and credit ratings on comparable securities. Certain
securities may be valued based upon quotes provided by one or more principal
market makers. Restricted securities, securities for which market quotations are
not readily available, and certain other assets may be fair valued under
procedures adopted by the Board of Trustees. Short-term investments that mature
in 60 days or less are valued at amortized cost, which approximates current
market value. Investments in other Nations Funds are valued at their net asset
value as determined by the applicable Nations Funds' prospectus.

Securities valuation: Securities are generally valued by an independent pricing
service. These valuations may be based upon a matrix pricing system and/or
appraisals which consider such factors as security prices, yields, maturities,
redemption features and credit ratings on comparable securities. Certain
securities may be valued based upon quotes provided by one or more principal
market makers. Restricted securities, securities for which market quotations are
not readily available, and certain other assets may be fair valued under
procedures adopted by the Board of Trustees. Short-term investments that mature
in 60 days or less are valued at amortized cost, which approximates current
market value. Investments in other Nations Funds are valued at their net asset
value as determined by the applicable Nations Funds' prospectus.

Securities valuation: Securities are generally valued by an independent pricing
service. These valuations may be based upon a matrix pricing system and/or
appraisals which considers such factors as security prices, yields, maturities,
redemption features and credit ratings on comparable securities. Certain
securities may be valued based upon quotes provided by one or more principal
market makers. Restricted securities, securities for which market quotations are
not readily available, and certain other assets may be fair valued under
procedures adopted by the Board of Trustees. Short-term investments that mature
in 60 days or less are valued at amortized cost, which approximates current
market value. Investments in other Nations Funds are valued at their net asset
value as determined by the applicable Nations Funds' prospectus.

----------
Securities valuation: Securities are generally valued by an independent pricing
service. These valuations may be based upon a matrix pricing system and/or
appraisals which considers such factors as security prices, yields, maturities,
redemption features and credit ratings on comparable securities. Certain
securities may be valued based upon quotes provided by one or more principal
market makers. Restricted securities, securities for which market quotations are
not readily available, and certain other assets may be fair valued under
procedures adopted by the Board of Trustees. Short-term investments that mature
in 60 days or less are valued at amortized cost, which approximates current
market value. Investments in other Nations Funds are valued at their net asset
value as determined by the applicable Nations Funds' prospectus.

Securities valuation: Securities are generally valued by an independent pricing
service. These valuations may be based upon a matrix pricing system and/or
appraisals which considers such factors as security prices, yields, maturities,
redemption features and credit ratings on comparable securities. Certain
securities may be valued based upon quotes provided by one or more principal
market makers. Restricted securities, securities for which market quotations are
not readily available, and certain other assets may be fair valued under
procedures adopted by the Board of Trustees. Short-term investments

Securities valuation: Securities are generally valued by an independent pricing
service. These valuations may be based upon a matrix pricing system and/or
appraisals which considers such factors as security prices, yields, maturities,
redemption features and credit ratings on comparable securities. Certain
securities may be valued based upon quotes provided by one or more principal
market makers. Restricted securities, securities for which market quotations are
not readily available, and certain other assets may be fair valued under
procedures adopted by the Board of Trustees. Short-term investments that mature
in 60 days or less are valued at amortized cost, which approximates current
market value. Investments in other Nations Funds are valued at their net asset
value as determined by the applicable Nations Funds' prospectus.

Securities valuation: Securities are generally valued by an independent pricing
service. These valuations may be based upon a matrix pricing system and/or
appraisals which considers such factors as security prices, yields, maturities,
redemption features and credit ratings on comparable securities. Certain
securities may be valued based upon quotes provided by one or more principal
market makers. Restricted securities, securities for which market quotations are
not readily available, and certain other assets may be fair valued under
procedures adopted by the Board of Trustees. Short-term investments that mature
in 60 days or less are valued at amortized cost, which approximates current
market value. Investments in other Nations Funds are valued at their net asset
value as determined by the applicable Nations Funds' prospectus.

Securities valuation: Securities, including options and futures contracts,
traded on a recognized exchange are generally valued at the last sale price on
the exchange or market on which such securities are primarily traded. Securities
traded on Nasdaq are generally valued at the Nasdaq official closing price.
Securities traded only over-the-counter are generally valued at the mean of the
latest bid and asked prices. Debt securities will generally be valued using
prices provided by a pricing service which may employ various indications of
value including but not limited to broker-dealer quotations. Restricted
securities, securities for which market quotations are not readily available,
and certain other assets may be fair valued under procedures adopted by the
Board of Trustees. Short-term investments that mature in 60 days or less are
valued at amortized cost, which approximates current market value. Investments
in other Nations Funds are valued at their net asset value as determined by the
applicable Nations Funds' prospectus.

Securities valuation: Securities, including options and futures contracts,
traded on a recognized exchange are generally valued at the last sale price on
the exchange or market on which such securities are primarily traded. Securities
traded on Nasdaq are generally valued at the Nasdaq official closing price.
Securities traded only over-the-counter are generally valued at the mean of the
latest bid and asked prices. Debt securities will generally be valued using
prices provided by a pricing service which may employ various indications of
value including but not limited to broker-dealer quotations. Restricted
securities, securities for which market quotations are not readily available,
and certain other assets may be fair valued under procedures adopted by the
Board of Trustees. Short-term investments that mature in 60 days or less are
valued at amortized cost, which approximates current market value. Investments
in other Nations Funds are valued at their net asset value as determined by the
applicable Nations Funds' prospectus.

----------
Securities valuation: Securities, including options and futures contracts,
traded on a recognized exchange are generally valued at the last sale price on
the exchange or market on which such securities are primarily traded. Securities
traded on Nasdaq are generally valued at the Nasdaq official closing price.
Securities traded only over-the-counter are generally valued at the mean of the
latest bid and asked prices. Debt securities will generally be valued using
prices provided by a pricing service which may employ various indications of
value including but not limited to broker-dealer quotations. Restricted
securities, securities for which market quotations are not readily available,
and certain other assets may be fair valued under procedures adopted by the
Board of Trustees. Short-term investments that mature in 60 days or less are
valued at amortized cost, which approximates current market value. Investments
in other Nations Funds are valued at their net asset value as determined by the
applicable Nations Funds' prospectus.

Securities valuation: Securities, including options and futures contracts,
traded on a recognized exchange are generally valued at the last sale price on
the exchange or market on which such securities are primarily traded. Securities
traded on Nasdaq are generally valued at the Nasdaq official closing price.
Securities traded only over-the-counter are generally valued at the mean of the
latest bid and asked prices. Debt securities will generally be valued using
prices provided by a pricing service which may employ various indications of
value including but not limited to broker-dealer quotations. Restricted
securities, securities for which market quotations are not readily available,
and certain other assets may be fair valued under procedures adopted by the
Board of Trustees. Short-term investments that mature in 60 days or less are
valued at amortized cost, which approximates current market value. Investments
in other Nations Funds are valued at their net asset value as determined by the
applicable Nations Funds' prospectus.

Securities valuation: Securities, including futures contracts, traded on a
recognized exchange are generally valued at the last sale price on the exchange
or market on which such securities are primarily traded. Securities traded on
Nasdaq are generally valued at the Nasdaq official closing price. Securities
traded only over-the-counter are generally valued at the mean of the latest bid
and asked prices. Securities which are primarily traded on foreign securities
exchanges are generally valued at the last available sale price on their
respective exchanges where primarily traded. Debt securities will generally be
valued using prices provided by a pricing service which may employ various
indications of value including but not limited to broker-dealer quotations.
Certain debt security prices provided by the pricing service may be based on a
matrix pricing system, which considers such factors as security prices, yields
and maturities on comparable securities. Restricted securities, securities for
which market quotations are not readily available, and certain other assets may
be fair valued under procedures adopted by the Board of Trustees. Short-term
investments that mature in 60 days or less are valued at amortized cost, which
approximates current market value. Investments in other Nations Funds are valued
at their net asset value as determined by the applicable Nations Funds'
prospectus.

Trading in securities on most foreign exchanges and over the counter markets is
normally completed before the close of the domestic stock market and may also
take place on days when the domestic market is closed. If events materially
affecting the value of foreign securities occur between the time when the
exchange on which they are traded closes and the time when the Master
Portfolio's net assets are calculated, such securities may be valued at fair
value in accordance with procedures adopted by the Board of Trustees. Nations
Funds has retained an independent fair value pricing service to assist in the
fair valuation process for Funds that primarily invest in international
securities.

----------
Securities valuation: Debt securities will generally be valued using prices
provided by a pricing service which may employ various indications of value
including but not limited to broker-dealer quotations. Certain debt security
prices provided by the pricing service may be based on a matrix pricing system,
which considers such factors as security prices, yields and maturities on
comparable securities. Certain securities may be valued based upon quotes
provided by one or more principal market makers. Securities, including options
and futures contracts, traded on a recognized exchange are generally valued at
the last sale price on the exchange or market on which such securities are
primarily traded. Securities traded on Nasdaq are generally valued at the Nasdaq
official closing price. Securities which are primarily traded on foreign
securities exchanges are generally valued at the last available sale price on
their respective exchanges where primarily traded. Restricted securities,
securities for which market quotations are not readily available, and certain
other assets may be fair valued under procedures adopted by the Board of
Trustees. Short-term investments that mature in 60 days or less are valued at
amortized cost, which approximates current market value. Investments in other
Nations Funds are valued at their net asset value as determined by the
applicable Nations Funds' prospectus.

----------
Securities valuation: Debt securities will generally be valued using prices
provided by a pricing service which may employ various indications of value
including but not limited to broker-dealer quotations. Certain debt security
prices provided by the pricing service may be based on a matrix pricing system,
which considers such factors as security prices, yields and maturities on
comparable securities. Certain securities may be valued based upon quotes
provided by one or more principal market makers. Securities, including options
and futures contracts, traded on a recognized exchange are generally valued at
the last sale price on the exchange or market on which such securities are
primarily traded. Securities traded on Nasdaq are generally valued at the Nasdaq
official closing price. Securities which are primarily traded on foreign
securities exchanges are generally valued at the last available sale price on
their respective exchanges where primarily traded. Restricted securities,
securities for which market quotations are not readily available, and certain
other assets may be fair valued under procedures adopted by the Board of
Trustees. Short-term investments that mature in 60 days or less are valued at
amortized cost, which approximates current market value. Investments in other
Nations Funds are valued at their net asset value as determined by the
applicable Nations Funds' prospectus.

Securities valuation: Debt securities will generally be valued using prices
provided by a pricing service which may employ various indications of value
including but not limited to broker-dealer quotations. Certain debt security
prices provided by the pricing service may be based on a matrix pricing system,
which considers such factors as security prices, yields and maturities on
comparable securities. Certain securities may be valued based upon quotes
provided by one or more principal market makers. Securities, including options
and futures contracts, traded on a recognized exchange are generally valued at
the last sale price on the exchange or market on which such securities are
primarily traded. Securities traded on Nasdaq are generally valued at the Nasdaq
official closing price. Securities which are primarily traded on foreign
securities exchanges are generally valued at the last available sale price on
their respective exchanges where primarily traded. Restricted securities,
securities for which market quotations are not readily available, and certain
other assets may be fair valued under procedures adopted by the Board of
Trustees. Short-term investments that mature in 60 days or less are valued at
amortized cost, which approximates current market value. Investments in other
Nations Funds are valued at their net asset value as determined by the
applicable Nations Funds' prospectus.

which considers such factors as security prices, yields and maturities on
comparable securities. Certain securities may be valued based upon quotes
provided by one or more principal market makers. Securities, including options
and futures contracts, traded on a recognized exchange are generally valued at
the last sale price on the exchange or market on which such securities are
primarily traded. Securities traded on Nasdaq are generally valued at the Nasdaq
official closing price. Securities which are primarily traded on foreign
securities exchanges are generally valued at the last available sale price on
their respective exchanges where primarily traded. Restricted securities,
securities for which market quotations are not readily available, and certain
other assets may be fair valued under procedures adopted by the Board of
Trustees. Short-term investments that mature in 60 days or less are valued at
amortized cost, which approximates current market value. Investments in other
Nations Funds are valued at their net asset value as determined by the
applicable Nations Funds' prospectus.

----------
Securities valuation: Debt securities will generally be valued using prices
provided by a pricing service which may employ various indications of value
including but not limited to broker-dealer quotations. Certain debt security
prices provided by the pricing service may be based on a matrix pricing system,
which considers such factors as security prices, yields and maturities on
comparable securities. Certain securities may be valued based upon quotes
provided by one or more principal market makers. Securities, including options
and futures contracts, traded on a recognized exchange are generally valued at
the last sale price on the exchange or market on which such securities are
primarily traded. Securities traded on Nasdaq are generally valued at the Nasdaq
official closing price. Securities which are primarily traded on foreign
securities exchanges are generally valued at the last available sale price on
their respective exchanges where primarily traded. Restricted securities,
securities for which market quotations are not readily available, and certain
other assets may be fair valued under procedures adopted by the Board of
Trustees. Short-term investments that mature in 60 days or less are valued at
amortized cost, which approximates current market value. Investments in other
Nations Funds are valued at their net asset value as determined by the
applicable Nations Funds' prospectus.

Securities valuation: Securities, including options and futures contracts,
traded on a recognized exchange are generally valued at the last sale price on
the exchange or market on which such securities are primarily traded. Securities
traded on Nasdaq are generally valued at the Nasdaq official closing price.
Securities which are primarily traded on foreign securities exchanges are
generally valued at the last available sale price on their respective exchanges
where primarily traded. Debt securities will generally be valued using prices
provided by a pricing service which may employ various indications of value
including but not limited to broker-dealer quotations. Certain debt security
prices provided by the pricing service may be based on a matrix pricing system,
which considers such factors as security prices, yields and maturities on
comparable securities. Certain securities may be valued based upon quotes
provided by one or more principal market makers. Restricted securities,
securities for which market quotations are not readily available, and certain
other assets may be fair valued under procedures adopted by the Board of
Trustees. Short-term investments that mature in 60 days or less are valued at
amortized cost, which approximates current market value. Investments in other
Nations Funds are valued at their net asset value as determined by the
applicable Nations Funds' prospectus.

----------
Securities valuation: Securities, including options and futures contracts,
traded on a recognized exchange are generally valued at the last sale price on
the exchange or market on which such securities are primarily traded. Securities
traded on Nasdaq are generally valued at the Nasdaq official closing price.
Securities which are primarily traded on foreign securities exchanges are
generally valued at the last available sale price on their respective exchanges
where primarily traded. Debt securities will generally be valued using prices
provided by a pricing service which may employ various indications of value
including but not limited to broker-dealer quotations. Certain debt security
prices provided by the pricing service may be based on a matrix pricing system,
which considers such factors as security prices, yields and maturities on
comparable securities. Certain securities may be valued based upon quotes
provided by one or more principal market makers. Restricted securities,
securities for which market quotations are not readily available, and certain
other assets may be fair valued under procedures adopted by the Board of
Trustees. Short-term investments that mature in 60 days or less are valued at
amortized cost, which approximates current market value. Investments in other
Nations Funds are valued at their net asset value as determined by the
applicable Nations Funds' prospectus.

----------
Securities valuation: Securities, including options and futures contracts,
traded on a recognized exchange are generally valued at the last sale price on
the exchange or market on which such securities are primarily traded. Securities
traded on Nasdaq are generally valued at the Nasdaq official closing price.
Securities which are primarily traded on foreign securities exchanges are
generally valued at the last available sale price on their respective exchanges
where primarily traded. Debt securities will generally be valued using prices
provided by a pricing service which may employ various indications of value
including but not limited to broker-dealer quotations. Certain debt security
prices provided by the pricing service may be based on a matrix pricing system,
which considers such factors as security prices, yields and maturities on
comparable securities. Certain securities may be valued based upon quotes
provided by one or more principal market makers. Restricted securities,
securities for which market quotations are not readily available, and certain
other assets may be fair valued under procedures adopted by the Board of
Trustees. Short-term investments that mature in 60 days or less are valued at
amortized cost, which approximates current market value. Investments in other
Nations Funds are valued at their net asset value as determined by the
applicable Nations Funds' prospectus.
